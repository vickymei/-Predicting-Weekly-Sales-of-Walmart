# Predicting-Weekly-Sales-of-Walmart
The Walmart data contains weekly sales for all stores and departments ranging from February 2010 to February 2011. Also since holidays can significantly affect sales, selected holiday markdown events are included in this dataset. Through proper dimension reduction and decomposition of time series, the goal of this project is to predict the weekly sales for each store and department from March 2011 to October 2012. Statistical analysis include median of historical data, stlf/SVD with ets, and stlf/SVD with ARIMA have been used for modeling. These models are evaluated based on the weighted-mean-absolute-error (WMAE) and running time.
